The "ps aux" would run and because it is the first in the piped order, the follow grep pizza command will not run yet.
The output of ps aux will be redirected to the stdin of the next command in line - the "grep" comamnd.
The grep command in turn will read from stdin to try and find the word pizza-margarita in it, at the moment the grep
command tries to read from stdin, the grep process is already running and so, the snapshot of ps at that moment will
contain the grep pizza command as well -> and will be returned as stdin to grep, which will makr this result.
